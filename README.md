# How-to-view-repos
A quick guide on how to view the source codes!


### Currently **all** source codes from my YouTube videos are *private*! To view the source codes consider [supporting my channel](https://www.patreon.com/codedred).



## For Supporters: 

*First off, thank you for supporting me!*

You are only a few steps away from viewing these repos! To be given access to your team, please join my community [Discord](https://discord.gg/gqwtqX3) to request access from either me or my server admins. Then, **you will need to connect your Patreon to Discord**. (for help see [this](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-How-do-I-connect-Discord-to-Patreon-Patron-)) Once that is completed, you should be able to view a channel named **request-github-access**. Please post your Github username in there and you will be given the access!

Don't have a Discord? No problem, please email me at contact@codedred.dev. Make sure to inform me of your Patreon name and your Github name!


## Current Repos:
Depending on the support status you will recieve access to certain repos.
